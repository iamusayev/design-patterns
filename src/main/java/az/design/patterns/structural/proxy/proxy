Design pattern: Proxy

===================================================================================================
Purpose:

To replace another object and control access to it.

===================================================================================================

What it is used for:

To provide access control to a specific object.

===================================================================================================
Example of use:

- When there is a need to reference an object in a way other than a normal pointer:
    remote substitution - local representation of an object in another address space
    virtual substitution - creation of "heavy objects" as the need arises
    protected substitution - object access control
    "smart reference - replacement of a usual pointer (counting the number of references, setting blocking, etc.)
